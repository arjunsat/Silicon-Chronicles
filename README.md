“From Silicon to Sovereignty, I choose to commit.”

As a student in the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program by IIT Gandhinagar and VSD, I see this not just as training, but as a national mission. Over 20 weeks, I will walk the path from RTL design to silicon tapeout, learning industry-grade flows, tools, and practices that prepare me for real-world chip design.

This is more than coursework — it’s my contribution toward India’s vision of “One Tapeout per Student” and the larger dream of semiconductor self-reliance. I commit to timely submissions, hands-on exploration, and consistent progress because I believe “this program is not only about skilling, it’s about nation-building.”

Each folder, each commit in this repository is proof of my dedication. Week by week, I document not only tasks and results but also the discipline, persistence, and belief that India’s semiconductor future is built by students like me.
