> **“From Silicon to Sovereignty, I choose to commit.”**  

As a student in the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** by **IIT Gandhinagar** and **VSD**, I see this not just as training, but as a **national mission**. Over 20 weeks, I will walk the path from **RTL design to silicon tapeout**, learning industry-grade flows, tools, and practices that prepare me for real-world chip design.  

This is more than coursework — it’s my contribution toward India’s vision of *“One Tapeout per Student”* and the larger dream of **semiconductor self-reliance**. I commit to timely submissions, hands-on exploration, and consistent progress because I believe *“this program is not only about skilling, it’s about nation-building.”*  

Each folder, each commit in this repository is proof of my dedication. Week by week, I document not only tasks and results but also the discipline, persistence, and belief that India’s semiconductor future is built by students like me.  

> *“Be part of the revolution,” they said. I am proud to say — *I already am.*  
 

I sincerely thank the **visionary leaders** , whose guidance, vision, and dedication are empowering students like me to transform knowledge into silicon, and learning into sovereignty.
